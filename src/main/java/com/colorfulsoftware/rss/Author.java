 * &lt;author> is an optional sub-element of &lt;item>.

 * 
 * <p>
 * It's the email address of the author of the item. For newspapers and
 * magazines syndicating via RSS, the author is the person who wrote the article
 * that the &lt;item> describes. For collaborative weblogs, the author of the
 * item might be different from the managing editor or webmaster. For a weblog
 * authored by a single individual it would make sense to omit the &lt;author>
 * element.
