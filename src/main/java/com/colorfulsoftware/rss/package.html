v1.0.0.0 - a Java feed library for the 
<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0</a> specification.

<p>Use this library to add rss feeds into your application. The api
is driven by the RSSDoc class which enables you to read and write rss
documents. The RSS element and all of its sub elements are serializable,
immutable and thread safe. See the <a
	href="http://www.colorfulsoftware.com/projects/rsspect">Project
Page</a> for examples of how to use the API.</p>
