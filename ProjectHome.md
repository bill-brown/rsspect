RSSpect is designed to be easy-to-use for solving RSS feed issues quickly.

It comes with an intuitive, developer-friendly API.
All objects in the library are serializable, immutable and thread-safe.

Fully tested for accuracy (See the distributed test-sources.jar for reference).

Minimal dependencies. RSSpect only requires a stax-api implementation to work.
